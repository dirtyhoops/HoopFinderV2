TODO:
1. maye make a "successful" msg in the API routes. along with the "error" messages. or maybe do this in the ACTION instead
2. in action, check the parameters if it's someone's profile, if it is then just use the parameters for the post userid call. if it's empty(if a logged in user is on his page), call the posts post api with the REQ.USER.ID
3. in  profile.js api route, in delete route, make sure to DELETE all the posts made by the user.
4. in profile route, once the court api routes and model are done, make sure to add a route to edit the profile to add the user's favorite court (id=ref, name, main image, rate).
